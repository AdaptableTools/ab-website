Adaptable Tools has launched a new podcast series consisting of interviews with leading figures in technology development within the FinTech space.  Over the coming weeks Adaptable Tools CEO Danielle Nagler will talk to those individuals - many of them unsung heroes - who are breaking new ground for users in Financial Services.  As well as offering insights into the innovations for which they are responsible, the series will provide perspectives on the future from those who have a key part to play in delivering it.

Grid Talks kicks off with Danielle in conversation with Niall Crosby, who has single-handedly transformed data management across business sectors with the development of ag-Grid.  He describes how personal frustration gave birth to what is now the world's most popular datagrid, and explains where the top tool may be headed next.

A new conversation will be published each Tuesday, and all the interviews can be accessed via [our dedicated web page](https://adaptabletools.com/grid-talks) .
