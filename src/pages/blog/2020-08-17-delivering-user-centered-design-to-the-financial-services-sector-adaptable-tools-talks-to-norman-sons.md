Financial Services is in need of a blend of California spirit and solid technology expertise to help it achieve the best possible software development to meet its needs going forward.   That’s the key message from Norman and Sons’ head Graeme Harker who has worked to bring in a unique user-centered design approach.  Combining designers, business people and developers he has succeeded in delivering a fresh approach which priviliges usability and delivers a real productivity dividend.

Harker sees NLP and interoperability as the big opportunity areas going forward, creating a better interface between those working in Financial Services and the technologies they rely and joining up separate applications.  Connectivity will be key, coupled with helping businesses and users to identify future needs using up and coming technological solutions.
