Data Re-Invention is overdue.  As costs of storage have dropped, Financial Services’ data streams have increased exponentially.  But turning “more” into “better” is challenging.  Increasingly businesses are grappling with multiple data sources, data fragmentation, lack of control and audit, and the difficulty of using data effectively to drive their businesses.

Data governance and effective data culture are key to success.  It is vital to consider not just how much data can be accessed, but to identify the key questions to ask of that data.  The challenge is then to find the tools, to build suitable foundations and architecture to embed data management effectively to support day-to-day operations.

There are a number of start-ups working at this frontier, to support the transformation process.  Prominent among them is Adaptable Tools, whose AdapTable component provides every possible feature to control data flows.  Easily flexible to any data, and any user parameters, it also offers full audit of data changes.  It can help manage Excel, and create and maintain a golden data source accessed by all.

It is clear that successful data management already has the ability to deliver competitive advantage.  But companies need to make an active choice to master data effectively if they want to avoid drowning.
