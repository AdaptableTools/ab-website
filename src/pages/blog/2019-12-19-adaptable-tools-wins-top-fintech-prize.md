The Adaptable Blotter, from FinTech start-up Adaptable Tools, has been voted top technology innovation by Europe’s leading banking professionals.

The Adaptable Blotter took top spot in the Dragon’s Den session for up and coming financial technology at the Fixed Income Leaders’ Summit held in Amsterdam on 6-8 November 2018.

John Greenan, industry expert and one of the summit dragons commented:

It's great to see technology that enhances operational and developmental productivity through excellence in design and implementation. Adaptable Tools won the Dragon's Den session and will continue to win for their clients.

Adaptable Tools CEO, Danielle Nagler added:

We’re delighted to get this vote of confidence in the Adaptable Blotter. It was pleasing that so many financial industry leaders recognised how the tool enables our users to be productive and efficient, eliminates huge waste and duplication in existing processes, and offers full standardisation across the financial desktop.
