Copy and paste should become history.  That’s the key message from ipushpull CEO Matthew Cheung.  In the latest episode of Adaptable Tools’ innovation podcast, Grid Talks, he describes the challenges in managing data in Financial Services and the potential for the data sharing platform to deliver consistent and effective connections between separate applications.

Cheung believes that the Covid-19 experience is turbo-charging the drive for connectivity, and that there will be no going back in expectations for data sharing regardless of physical location.

In a wide-ranging interview, Cheung suggests that the days when the buzz was around Big Data are over, and data security and audit are becoming increasingly critical.
