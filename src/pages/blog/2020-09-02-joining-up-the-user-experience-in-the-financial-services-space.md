We need to address the difficulties of working in the browser effectively, and get into the headspace of users.  So says Dan Schleifer of Cosaic as he considers the barriers to connectivity across Financial Services technology.

The shift to browser-based software represents a challenge for the whole FinTech sector, says Cosaic’s Dan Schleifer, and we need to break out of the user tab and become more creative around the experiences being built.

Collaboration with smart technology such as AdapTable is key to building breakthrough technology frameworks.  But we all need to work hard to deliver imaginative solutions, and to sign up to the open standards that can facilitate innovation.

Schleifer is the latest interviewee in Adaptable Tools’ new podcast series, Grid Talks, which focuses on FinTech innovation.  [You can listen to the whole conversation with Adaptable Tools CEO Danielle Nagler here](https://adaptabletools.com/grid-talks/), and find out more about Cosaic’s work to tackle the workflow problem.
