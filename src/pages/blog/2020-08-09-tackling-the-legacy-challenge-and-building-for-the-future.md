With so many other challenges, it is always tempting to look at systems and hope that they can be patched and left a little while longer.

But failing to modernise legacy systems can leave businesses seriously disadvantaged.  Old technology simply wasn’t configured for today’s data-powered opportunities.  And confining systems to the desktop hampers the flexible working Covid-19 requires.

Fixing plumbing is never sexy.  But waiting for a major leak is dangerous.  Increasing waves of data threaten to become overwhelming.  Smart businesses recognise the need to move to the browser, to benefit from the tools available and the potential mobility of web systems.  

Companies such as Adaptable Tools are working on that frontier with innovative solutions such as AdapTable to harness increased data flows effectively.  Modernisation means building architecture not just for today, but for tomorrow too.  It needs imagination and tools which can flex.  

If buyers work creatively to build systems which can grow, and suppliers offer tools which are unconstrained, together they can build transformation.
