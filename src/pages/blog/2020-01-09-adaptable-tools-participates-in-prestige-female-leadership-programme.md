Alongside early stage businesses looking at challenges in AI, shipping logistics, property  investment and fashion, Adaptable Tools received mentoring from leading Israeli startup entrepreneurs to explore ways further to develop the business.
Adaptable Tools’ CEO, Danielle Nagler, presented the business to investors and journalists as part of a final showcase.
