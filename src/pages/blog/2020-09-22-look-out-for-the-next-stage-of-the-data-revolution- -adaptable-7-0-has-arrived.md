**Adaptable Tools provides the data controls of the future with its delivery of AdapTable 7.0.** 

The market-leading toolkit already offered the most powerful functionality available, but with this latest version, AdapTable takes a giant leap forward.

Danielle Nagler, CEO of Adaptable Tools, describes how:

> _We observed the data challenges our users are dealing with every day, and we worked on delivering the solutions that will be game-changing for them.  We also wanted to respond to the increase in time working from home usually with smaller screens.  Our upgrade means that complex data management can become easier and more intuitive, even where screen real estate is constrained._

## Back to Basics

Building on an extended range of features such as Gradient Columns, Scheduled Reports, Alerts, Team Sharing, State Management and Audit Log, AdapTable v. 7.0 focuses on addressing core functionality in an effort to boost user productivity and efficiency.

As Jonny Wolfson, CTO of Adaptable Tools, explains:

> _The changes we have made will save further development time and risk in creating data-driven applications.  They enable AdapTable to go far beyond any feature-set currently available in the market and will let teams concentrate on other areas of data management while delivering sophisticated tools to users._

## Filtering and Searching

Version 7 makes it easier than ever to find key data quickly, while also facilitating the creation of more bespoke and complex searches.  It includes a new Query function which enables the creation of multi-column queries using complex logic.  These queries can then be saved and used elsewhere in AdapTable.

And filtering has become easier than ever with the most powerful set of filters available on the street - while users can provide custom filters for bespoke use cases.

## Calculated Columns

Calculated Columns – one of AdapTable’s most popular functions - has had a complete makeover to enhance its ability to deliver to complex needs across multiple scenarios.  This includes the ability to drag and drop, and testing and styling capabilities. 

## Layouts

Layouts now update automatically as the grid changes, and the multi-step wizard has been replaced with a one-screen Layout editor in which the user can set:

* \- Column Visibility
* \- Column Order
* \- Sorting Information
* \- Aggregations and Summaries
* \- Row Grouping
* \- Pivoting Details

## Other Improvements

Other highlights in AdapTable 7.0 include:

* \- Substantial enhancements to React and Angular Wrappers
* \- The addition of ‘Scope’ so that the same Conditional Style can be used across multiple columns of a given DataType (e.g. Number).
* \- Ranges added to Percent Bars so different colours display based on cell value
* \- Enhanced support for Master-Detail and Tree View grids
* \- Improvements to custom themes and styles
* \- Many new Adaptable API methods so everything available in the GUI can also be done programmatically via code.
