Every business now understands the value of data – and the need to find appropriate ways to use it.  But getting data to deliver all it is capable of is another matter.  

It is not enough just to collect or assemble data and hope that it will drive business performance.  Data management and analytics are key to seeing data genuinely improve decision-making and minimise risk.

This requires confronting a few basic challenges:

* 

\- Bringing together proprietary data with that from third parties in a seamless way

* 

\- Being able to handle large amounts of dynamic data, effortlessly

* 

\- Breaking down internal data silos – but still ensuring that users can find the data that they want and need

The range of solutions on offer available can be bewildering.  First and foremost what is needed is a real understanding of how data can drive business performance.  Then you need a tool like AdapTable which is flexible enough to offer one framework solution to multiple needs and outputs, and which can evolve with requirements.  

Partway through a revolution it is foolish to lock in to a system for all time.  By embracing those ideas of flexibility and evolution, it becomes possible to love data and find it a place at the heart of the organisation.
