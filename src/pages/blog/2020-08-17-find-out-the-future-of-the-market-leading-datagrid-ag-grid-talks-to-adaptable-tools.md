It’s vital we continue to respect the Grid and its complexity.  That’s the key message from the man who in a typically understated way has done more than anyone else to change the face of data management across industries.

Frustrated by what was available on the market, Niall Crosby built ag-Grid version one over the Christmas holidays, with Indiana Jones on in the background.  The market-leading data management tool now boasts 800,000 downloads of its community version, and 5000 business customers for its enterprise edition, including at least half of the Fortune 500.  Like us at Adaptable Tools, they admire it for its speed, power, and ease of use and we've worked hard to ensure AdapTable only adds to the functionality it can deliver.

According to Niall, going forward we will see a coming together of BI tools and applications within the web space.  In a wide-ranging discussion with Adaptable Tools CEO Danielle Nagler, Niall promises that the company will continue to focus on providing the best grid it can and will avoid distractions.
