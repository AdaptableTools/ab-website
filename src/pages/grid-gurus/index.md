  # Controlling data properly requires a range of tools and specialist skills: 
  AdapTable is one part of the jigsaw, Grid Gurus provide the missing pieces.
description: >
  At Adaptable Tools we have built a team that can help you with every aspect of
  your data project. 


  Nicknamed the Grid Gurus, our consultants have a deep understanding of all the
  options available in the market and provide objective input to help design
  your system and build it quickly and cost-efficiently.  


  Grid Gurus can be fully integrated into a development project, or come in for
  a few days to provide direction and specialist configuration.  They can get a
  Proof of Concept up and running, or set up and configure your DataGrids to
  suit your precise requirements, leaving the regular development team free to
  do other things.

### How it Works

A member of our Grid Gurus’ team can come in for as little as one day to add value to your project. They can work with you at any stage of the project, although our clients find they add most value if used at the start, to help avoid expensive, time-costly mistakes. They can work on or off site, delivering to any project deadlines.

We can also put together a number of individuals for more complex work. We match skills to the particular challenges and specialisms required, providing a service that can address exactly what you need. The service is priced on a time basis, with competitive rates available for longer projects. [Get In Touch](mailto:sales@adaptabletools.com) to find out more.
