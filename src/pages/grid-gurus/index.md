  At Adaptable Tools we have built a team to help with every aspect of your data
  project. 

  Our Grid Gurus have a deep understanding of all the options available in the
  market and provide objective input to help design your system and build it
  quickly and cost-efficiently.  They can be fully integrated into a development
  project, or come in for a few days to provide direction and specialist
  configuration.  They can get a Proof of Concept up and running, or set up and
  configure a grid for you, leaving the regular development team free to do
  other things.

### How it Works

A member of our Grid Gurus’ team can come in for as little as one day to add value to your project.  They can work with you at any stage of the project, although our clients find they add most value if used at the start, to help avoid expensive, time-costly mistakes. They can work on or off site, delivering to any project deadlines.  We can also put together a number of individuals for more complex work.  We match skills to the particular challenges and specialisms required, providing a service that can address exactly what you need.  The service is priced on a time basis, with competitive rates available for longer projects.  Get in touch LINK TO SALES EMAIL to find out more.
