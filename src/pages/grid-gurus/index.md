  # Data solutions require specialist skills:  AdapTable is one part of the
  jigsaw; Grid Gurus helps provide the missing pieces.
description: >-
  At Adaptable Tools we can help you with every aspect of your data project. 


  Nicknamed The Grid Gurus, our consultants have a deep understanding of all the
  options available in the market and can offer objective input to help design
  your solution and build it quickly and cost-efficiently.  


  Grid Gurus can be fully integrated into a development project, or come in for
  a few days to provide direction and specialist configuration.  They can get a
  Proof of Concept up and running, or set up and configure a DataGrid to suit
  your precise requirements, while the regular development team is freed up to
  do other things.


  The Adaptable Tools' team specialises in delivering value-driven solutions,
  and they don't duck the difficult questions.  They also run an open surgery
  for grid-related queries, and you can see their responses to some of the
  issues raised [here](https://demo.adaptabletools.com/gridgurus/asktheexperts).

### How it Works

One of our Grid Gurus can come in for as little as one day to add value to your project. They can work with you at any stage, although our clients find they add most value if used at the start when they can help to avoid expensive, time-costly mistakes. They can work on or off site, delivering to any project deadlines.

We can also put together a specialist team for more complex work. We match skills to the particular challenges and knowledge areas required, providing a service focussed on exactly what you need. The service is priced on a time basis, with competitive rates available for longer projects. [Get In Touch](mailto:sales@adaptabletools.com) to find out more.
