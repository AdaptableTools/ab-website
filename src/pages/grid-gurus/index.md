  Controlling data properly requires a range of tools and specialist skills. 
  The Adaptable Blotter [Link] is only one part of the jigsaw. 
description: >
  At Adaptable Tools we have built a team to help with every aspect of your data
  project. 

  Our Grid Gurus have a deep understanding of all the options available in the
  market and provide objective input to help design your system and build it
  quickly and cost-efficiently.  They can be fully integrated into a development
  project, or come in for a few days to provide direction and specialist
  configuration.  They can get a Proof of Concept up and running, or set up and
  configure a grid for you, leaving the regular development team free to do
  other things.
