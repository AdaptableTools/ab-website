Adaptable Tools, and our core product AdapTable, work at the frontiers of Financial Services technology. We are focussed on changing the way that systems work so that companies and users can work in ways that were never before possible. And we work alongside others who are similarly committed to turning technological possibilities into transformation.

In Grid Talks, Adaptable Tools’ CEO Danielle Nagler interviews leading figures in the Financial Services technology revolution. This unique series of podcasts gives insights into groundbreaking inventions as well as offering perspectives on the future from some of those involved in building it. It’s your chance to find out what could be next.
